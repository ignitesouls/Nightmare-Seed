# Nightmare-Seed

## Introductions
Hear y- AHEM!
Hear ye, hear ye, good citizens of IGNITE!

Sorry, I was so choked up from this momentous occasion, I had to compose myself for this insane announcement. An announcement of all announcements. Surely, it will drive you to strip to your skivvies and embrace the three fingered hug, as you will give in to frenzy long before you find victory, or solace for that matter.

We want to apologize in advance, actually. We cooked an absolutely malicious and evil Elden Ring randomizer mod. Our apologies will do nothing to help you though, because there is no help where you're going. We speak of **THE NIGHTMARE SEED**. Yes, the one you've heard whispers of, for months. It's available. NOW.

It cannot be understated how difficult **THE NIGHTMARE SEED** truly is. It is in your best interest to understand that this is the most unfair Elden Ring experience you may ever have, and prepare accordingly, lest your subconscious mind suffers a catastrophic Aeonian explosion, lest you feast upon the corpses of your fallen comrades, and lest you descend into the madness that can only be upheld by the strength of the stalwart honse Leonard.

So much effort, passion, and EVIL SCHEMING went into the creation of this mod. Let's all give our thanks to Nexus  and Shura for this insanely complex endeavor. There were other contributors to **THE NIGHTMARE SEED**, and if you explore the mod, you will even find acknowledgements for their contributions within the game.

Truly, we are blessed with evil. Let us confront our fears and conquer the deep of unconsecrated night.

Good luck and have fun!

## How to Install 
Download the Version you want and Unzip to anywhere on your PC. Then Click on `launchmod_rando.bat` and enjoy.

If your mod is not launching you may need to turn off the Overlay.
To do this you must open `config_eldenringrandomizer.toml` and delete the Overlay connection. Your config file should now look like this:

```
[modengine]
debug = false
external_dlls = [
	
]
[extension.mod_loader]
enabled = true
loose_params = false
mods = [
    { enabled = true, name = "randomizer", path = "Nightmare v1" },
]
```

## Problematic Items
I will attempt to solves these one day but there are some problematic items that spawn from some players and not others. So if you don't have these items make sure to spawn them in.

**Current List of Items that you should get:**

- Discarded Palace Key after Makar Replacement

- Somber 3 Bell Bearing After Fire Giant Replacement

- Somber 5 Bell Bearing After Loretta, Knight of the Haligtree Replacement

**If you don't get them make sure to spawn them in**

- Made a Safety Check of Shards As the "**Ailment Talisman**" Replacement at the **Abandoned Ailing Village**. Don't Grab it unless you weren't able to get all 16 shards


## Completions
These are those who have Streamed and Completed. We know there are others who have completed the Nightmare but just to be consistent we only go off of those we can confirm.
